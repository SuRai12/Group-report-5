**Introduction**

The primary goal of our project is to investigate language characteristics by using skin care product reviews as our data source. When individuals are considering the purchase of a product, they often reference the associated customer reviews. These language features extracted from the reviews can heighten a person's interest in and desire to acquire the product.
By observing the sentiment expressed within these product reviews, we aim to analyze how the reviews influence customer purchasing decisions. Do positive reviews lead to a higher likelihood of the customer making a purchase? Conversely, do negative reviews deter potential customers? Through this analysis, we hope to develop a model that can predict the chances of a customer re-purchasing a product based on the language used in the existing reviews.
Ultimately, a deeper understanding of how product review language impacts consumer behavior could provide valuable insights for companies seeking to optimize their marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction. The findings from this project may enable businesses to better cater to the needs and preferences of their target audience.


**Methodology**

Our research targets mainly focus on 3 fields, product reviews from editors, shopping platforms, and official websites. After obtaining around 60 reviews from various skin care review websites, the following steps are data cleaning and annotation of the data we collected. For the data cleaning part, we will use Python, input the code, cleaning unnecessary information from the reviews from colab, for example, punctuation and spacing. We believe that punctuation can’t tell the difference or represent individual emotions. Thus, we need a pure text to focuse on the literal meaning or wording of the respondents. For adding annotation, we believe that even data cleaning the unnecessary items, not the whole texts could show buyer consumption choices or emotions. Hence, we created equivalent annotations and then marked in the text, the progress would better assist us to extract useful information or elements which benefical to our further analysis. 





**Discussion**
After we collected the data, we observed that most of the customer were not very satisfied with their consumption choice, even if they gave a high score they still complained about it or believed there was an improvement in the product. The minority represents anger because the product is unable to meet their standard. By understanding this statement, we think these reviews may affect people's customing choices, especially if a person without any opinions or someone reads a comment carelessly. Some reviewers gave bad comments but the ranking is high, therefore it is impossible to be sure at all. In addition, some of the comments are about accepting money and they will only praise it, for consumers, it has no reference value. However, consumers are in vain and easily priced out and celebrity and platform certifications affect their judgment. 

Based on this situation, we believe it is difficult to directly predict the chance of re-buying a product. We found many customers are not fully satisfied with their choice, but they are not aware it may be their fault, they just believe the rating but not well thought out.  Furthermore, the presence of biased reviews, such as those influenced by monetary incentives or celebrity endorsements, diminishes the reference value for consumers.
To be honest, there is insufficient information for customers as references, so it is challenging to determine the precise likelihood of re-buying a product. The one thing, we firmed was that if the customers had bad comments, they definitely would not purchase it again.
