Introduction (Su) 

The primary goal of our project is to investigate language characteristics by using skin care product reviews as our data source. When individuals are considering the purchase of a product, they often reference the associated customer reviews. These language features extracted from the reviews can heighten a person's interest in and desire to acquire the product.
By observing the sentiment expressed within these product reviews, we aim to analyze how the reviews influence customer purchasing decisions. Do positive reviews lead to a higher likelihood of the customer making a purchase? Conversely, do negative reviews deter potential customers? Through this analysis, we hope to develop a model that can predict the chances of a customer re-purchasing a product based on the language used in the existing reviews.
Ultimately, a deeper understanding of how product review language impacts consumer behavior could provide valuable insights for companies seeking to optimize their marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction. The findings from this project may enable businesses to better cater to the needs and preferences of their target audience.

Methodology (Beth)
Collection, cleaning, analysis 

Our research targets mainly focus on 3 fields, product reviews from editors, shopping platforms, and official websites. After obtaining data from these skin care review websites, the following steps are data cleaning and annotation. 

For the data cleaning part, we will use Python code to clean unnecessary information from the reviews, for example, punctuation and spacing. We believe that punctuation can’t tell the difference or represent individual emotions. Thus, we focused on the literal meaning or wording of the respondents.
